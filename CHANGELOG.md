### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* logging is in a new module: asap::logging.

Many modules would want to only get the basic common functionality
without pulling extra 3rd party dependencies such as spdlog, fmt etc...
For this reason, the logging functionality is taken out of the common
submodule and moved to logging submodule.

* move logging functionality to separate module ([46f4dd9](http://github.com/abdes/asap/commit/46f4dd96edb1148e0772a1539b989fd80f3821e4))
